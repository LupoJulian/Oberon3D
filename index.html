                   It all started as a hobbie using sculptris: an old and limited, very limited, sculpt program wich introduced me into "3d sculpting world". Time pass and I kept working and working on some designs just for fun, (lot of them inspired in insects and biomechanic creatures, just as always) until I decided to start a "Zbrush" sculpting course in "Crehana". Now on I keep learning from it, i finished it in early 2021 and started this project named in my favourite character of a game: (Oberon from Warframe) Oberon3D. I can still remember <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CK2ai1OjUcx/" target="_blank">my first model</a>, a tiny demon I made and later printed in resin, I was so excited... and then the brainstorm started and thankfully I was able to grow a lot inside the industry, it was new for me, but people began to be interested in my designs and I found myself sculpting diferent models for people and for fun. You know what they say. "
                   Work what you like and you'll not work a single day of your life " And here I am, making your ideas born, for you, for me, for us.

                   I have 2 materials to make your ideas born. One is the PLA(poly-lactic-acid), it's really useful, and normally the best material to introduce yourself in 3D printing, its popularity is due to his huge capability of adaptation for any work, and his diverse tones and styles. Overall it is good, cheap and versatile. Meanwhile our second material is the resin. It is my favourite from both, it offers a huge (and I mean HUGE) detail ability, its pieces resolution can go between 25 to 100 microns! It's mostly used for high-detailed pieces or figures that will stay still. Concluding, it is more expensive, and it takes more time, but you'll have a high detailed, solid version of your dream.
